What is git?
************

Git is a version control software, and as such it is used to track modifications to source code of your project.
The tutorials linked below provide details about the inner workings and advantages of doing version control with git.


Why use git?
************

When multiple people collaborative develop a piece of code there are numerous check and balances required to:

* Share what each indivudual develops.
* Avoid any loss of work.
* Manage so-called conflicts that arise when multiple collaborators are developing in parallel.

These check and balances apply equally to a large team in a multi-national company developing propriety software, and also to a small university team working on a curricular or co-curricular project.

Git is currently the most widely used software for versioning control of code, as opposed to versioning control of documents such as pdf or docx files for example. As the framework and algorithms for implementing an autonomous system are code-based, git is a natural choice for versioning control of such a project.
