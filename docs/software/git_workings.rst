Working with Git
================


Links to git tutorials
**********************

You can find many great git tutorials on the web, for example:

* `Atlassian Bit Bucket tutorials for beginners <https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/what-is-version-control>`_
* `Git Handbook on Github Guides <https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/>`_
* `Git Cheat Sheet by Github <https://training.github.com>`_
* `MUEEC Git Workshop recording on YouTube <https://youtu.be/vUgsyfbOUl4>`_
* `The coding train git playlist on YouTube <https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6ZF9C0YMKuns9sLDzK6zoiV>`_


Where to host your git
**********************

Although you can host a git repository on your PC, it is typical to host it on a server with a browser-based interface.
Popular websites for hosting git repositories are:

* `Github <https://github.com>`_
* `BitBucket <https://bitbucket.org>`_
* `GitLab <https://about.gitlab.com>`_

The University of Melbourne also has instances of GitLab running on its servers so that you can rest assured that you data is local and safe:

* UoM-wide: `gitlab.unimelb.edu.au <http://gitlab.unimelb.edu.au/>`_
* FEIT: `gitlab.eng.unimelb.edu.au <http://gitlab.eng.unimelb.edu.au/>`_

..
  The remaining details on this page assume that you are using the UoM-wide GitLab instance.

Clone your git
**************

Once you have created a git repository on a server and initialized it, you can clone the repository to your local machine using

.. code-block::

  git clone <url>

where :code:`<url>` is replaced with the URL of you repository, for example:

.. code-block::

  git clone https://gitlab.unimelb.edu.au/asclinic/asclinic-system.git

If you have setup your account on the server to work with ssh keys from your PC (see `these GitLab instructions <https://gitlab.unimelb.edu.au/help/ssh/README>`_ for example)
then the :code:`<url>` uses the format :code:`git@`, for example:

.. code-block::

  git@gitlab.unimelb.edu.au:asclinic/asclinic-system.git


Typical git workflow
********************

* Add, edit, delete files on your PC using your favourite text editor and file manager (i.e., :code:`cp`, :code:`vi`, :code:`rm`)

* :code:`git status` to display the files you have changed.

* :code:`git diff` to display the content of the files you have changed, highlighting only the changes you made, i.e., the :code:`diff` erences.

* :code:`git pull` to fetch and integrate changes from the server and provide you with an initial indication of potential merge conflicts.

  * **Note:** :code:`git pull` does not delete any of the changes your made, it only integrates changes from the server if they cause no conflects.

* :code:`git add .` to add all changes you made to the staging index.

  * **Note:** to add individual files, use `git add <file_path_and_name>`

* :code:`git status` to display the files are staged and ready to be committed.

* :code:`git commit -m "<Write a descriptive commit message here>"` to commit the stage files locally.

  * **Note:** be sure to write a descriptive commit message as you do not know what future reason will cause you to be looking back through your commits.
  * **Note:** committed changes are only local to your PC.

* :code:`git status` to double check that the commit was successful.

* :code:`git push` to upload your commits to the repository on the server.


View previous commits
*********************

* :code:`git log` to display the version history of the current branch.

* :code:`git log --stat` to display also some statistics about the version history.

* :code:`git log --help` to display the manual entry for :code:`git log`

* :code:`git diff <commit1> <commit2>` to display the differences between :code:`<commit1>` and :code`<commit2>`, which are the hash keys displayed by :code:`git log`

* :code:`git diff --help` to display the manual entry for :code:`git diff`
