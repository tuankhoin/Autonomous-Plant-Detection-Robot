# Autonomous Plant Detection Robot

This is the ROS source code for the main project of ELEN90090 - Autonomous Systems Clinic (SM1 2023). The task is to program and design a robot to autonomously traverse a course and detect/inspect the plants in the area.

Tech stack: ROS, C++, Python, opencv (Computer Vision), pytorch (Deep learning), mmcv library (object detection).

Our implementation was the second earliest to completed in implementation. Our demonstration video (coming soon), was deemed to be the best among 11 teams.
